# Event Outreach Routine

**Trigger:** Manual — create a Paperclip issue assigned to `marketing-specialist` to fire this routine  
**Concurrency policy:** `skip_if_active` — one event run at a time  
**Catch-up policy:** `skip_missed`

---

## Overview

Generic, reusable conference/event outreach module. All event-specific data lives in SharePoint config — zero code changes needed per event. Handles missing email discovery via Hunter.io before sending. Processes attendees in configurable batches with a sufficiency gate before sending.

---

## Global Conventions

- **Timestamps:** ISO-8601 UTC — `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
- **SharePoint base:** `Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/`
- **Config file:** `Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/config.md` (read on every run — always fresh)
- **HTML emails:** All emails MUST use `bodyType: "HTML"` or `isHtml: true`. Never plain text.
- **Audit columns:** Written back to the same Excel file. Never modify input data columns.
- **Excel reads — NEVER read the full sheet.** Always use a column-range address (e.g. `BW:CF`). Read header row (`A1:ZZ1`) first to find column letters, then read only the needed columns. Full-sheet reads cause token overflow on large files.
- **Hunter API key:** Read from env var `HUNTER_API_KEY` — never hardcode.
- **Idempotency:** Row is skipped if ANY of these are true:
  - `pc_status` = `sent` / `draft_created` / `skipped` (this event's audit columns), OR
  - `email_delivery_status` = `sent` (pre-existing column from prior system — never reprocess)
  Never re-draft or re-send to a row already marked sent by any system.

## SharePoint Folder Structure

Each event gets its own isolated folder. No shared config — no cross-event collision.

```
Marketing-Specialist/
└── event-outreach/
    ├── asca-samba-2026/
    │   ├── config.md                    ← edit this per event (14 fields)
    │   ├── email-template.html          ← full email body, edit per event
    │   ├── column-map.md               ← auto-generated on first run, never touch

```

**Config path per event:** `Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/config.md`  
**Attendee file path:** `Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/{attendee_file}`  
**Run logs path:** `Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/run-logs/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

The routine derives all paths from `event_slug` in config — you never hardcode a path.

---

## Excel Columns

### Column map — parsed once, cached per event

The agent does NOT assume column names. On first run it reads all headers, infers which column maps to which field, stores the result in SharePoint. Every subsequent run loads the cached map — no re-detection.

**Cached file:** `Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/column-map.md`

```markdown
# Column Map — {event_slug}
# Auto-generated on first run. Edit manually only if headers change.
# Format: canonical_field: exact_header_as_it_appears_in_excel | column_index

first_name:  First Name   | 0
last_name:   Last Name    | 1
email:       Email        | 2
company:     Company Name | 3
domain:      Website      | 4     ← optional, absent = -1
title:       Job Title    | 5     ← optional, absent = -1
```

### Canonical field inference rules (used only on first run)

| Canonical field | Match any of these (case-insensitive, partial ok) |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `first_name` | first name, firstname, fname, given name, first |
| `last_name` | last name, lastname, lname, surname, family name, last |
| `email` | email, e-mail, email address, work email, contact email |
| `company` | company, company name, organization, organisation, employer, account, firm |
| `domain` | domain, website, url, web, site |
| `title` | title, job title, jobtitle, position, role, designation |
| `prior_delivery_status` | email_delivery_status, delivery_status, mail_delivery_status, send_status |

Required canonical fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `company`  
Optional: `email` (Hunter fills if absent), `domain`, `title`, `prior_delivery_status` (prior system sent flag)

### Audit columns (agent writes — auto-created on first run)

| Column | Values |
|--------|--------|
| `pc_status` | `pending` → `sent` / `draft_created` / `email_not_found` / `skipped` / `error` |
| `pc_email_source` | `original` / `hunter` / `none` |
| `pc_email_used` | Final email address used (original or Hunter-found) |
| `pc_draft_created_at` | ISO timestamp when draft was created in Outlook |
| `pc_sent_at` | ISO timestamp when email was actually sent (filled on approval/send — blank until then) |
| `pc_event` | `{event_slug}` from config — links row to specific event |
| `pc_draft_id` | Outlook draft message ID (only if `send_mode: draft_review`) |
| `pc_hunter_confidence` | Hunter confidence score (0–100) if Hunter was used |
| `pc_hunter_method` | `email_finder` / `domain_search` / `none` — which Hunter method found the email |
| `pc_email_risk` | `deliverable` / `risky` / `undeliverable` — Hunter verify result |
| `pc_notes` | Error detail or skip reason |
| `pc_delivery_status` | `delivered` / `bounced` — filled by PRE-CHECK A after 24hrs |
| `pc_delivery_notes` | Bounce reason (first 200 chars of NDR) |
| `pc_reply_received` | `yes` / blank — filled by PRE-CHECK B |
| `pc_reply_intent` | `demo_interest` / `out_of_office` / `positive` / `negative` / `neutral` |
| `pc_reply_snippet` | First 100 chars of reply body |

---

## PRE-CHECK A — Delivery Status (bounces for rows sent >24hrs ago)

Run this before anything else. Updates Excel with bounce data from prior sends.

```
A1. Read event_slug from issue description (same as Phase 0 — needed for file paths).
    If missing, skip pre-checks and go straight to Phase 0.

A2. Read ONLY audit columns — never read the full sheet (full read = token overflow):

    STEP 1: Read header row only to find audit column letters:
    sharepoint_excel_read_range
    → address: "A1:ZZ1"   ← header row only, all columns
    → find index of: pc_status, pc_event, pc_email_used, pc_sent_at, pc_delivery_status, pc_delivery_notes
    → convert index to Excel column letter (A=0, B=1, ... Z=25, AA=26, ...)

    STEP 2: Read ONLY those audit columns for all data rows:
    sharepoint_excel_read_range
    → address: "{pc_status_col}:{pc_delivery_notes_col}"   ← audit columns only, no limit on rows

    Identify rows where ALL of:
    → pc_status = "sent" AND pc_event = {event_slug}
    → pc_delivery_status is empty (not yet checked)

    Check every sent row regardless of when it was sent — no 24hr restriction.
    If none: skip to PRE-CHECK B.

A3. For each such row:
    Check Outlook inbox for bounce/NDR:
    outlook_search_mail
    → mailbox: {outlook_user}
    → query: "from:mailer-daemon OR from:postmaster {pc_email_used}"
    → look for bounce/NDR referencing that email address

    If bounce found in Outlook:
    → pc_delivery_status = "bounced"
    → pc_delivery_notes = bounce reason (first 200 chars of NDR body)
    → continue to next row

    If no Outlook bounce found:
    → pc_delivery_status = "delivered"
    → pc_delivery_notes = blank

A4. sharepoint_excel_write_range → write pc_delivery_status + pc_delivery_notes for updated rows

A5. Post comment:
    "PRE-CHECK A: {delivered_count} delivered, {bounced_count} bounced, {skipped_count} skipped (< 24hrs or already checked)."
```

---

## PRE-CHECK B — Reply Detection (scan inbox for replies)

```
B1. Read ONLY pc_email_used + pc_reply_received columns (never full sheet):
    sharepoint_excel_read_range
    → address: "{pc_email_used_col}:{pc_reply_snippet_col}"   ← reply audit columns only
    → collect all pc_email_used values where pc_reply_received is empty

    Then scan Outlook inbox:
    outlook_list_messages
    → mailbox: {outlook_user}
    → folder: Inbox
    → filter: last 7 days
    → Look for emails whose sender address matches any collected pc_email_used value

B2. For each matching reply:
    Read subject + first 500 chars of body.

    Classify intent:
    → "demo_interest"   — mentions demo, meeting, call, interested, learn more, schedule
    → "unsubscribe"     — unsubscribe, remove me, opt out, stop emailing
    → "out_of_office"   — out of office, OOO, away, vacation, maternity/paternity
    → "positive"        — thanks, looks good, great, will share, forwarding
    → "negative"        — not interested, no thanks, wrong person, irrelevant
    → "neutral"         — everything else

B3. Write reply status back to Excel:
    sharepoint_excel_write_range
    → pc_reply_received = "yes"
    → pc_reply_intent   = {classified intent}
    → pc_reply_snippet  = first 100 chars of reply body

B4. For any row classified as "demo_interest":
    resend_send_email
    → from: {outlook_user}
    → to: {review_email}
    → subject: "[{event_name}] Demo interest — {first_name} {last_name} ({company})"
    → html:
      <p><strong>{first_name} {last_name}</strong> ({title}, {company}) replied with interest.</p>
      <p><strong>Their email:</strong> {pc_email_used}</p>
      <p><strong>Reply snippet:</strong> {reply_snippet}</p>
      <p>Follow up promptly — this is a warm lead.</p>

B5. Post comment:
    "PRE-CHECK B: {reply_count} replies found.
     Demo interest: {demo_count} | Unsubscribe: {unsub_count} | OOO: {ooo_count} | Other: {other_count}
     {demo_count > 0 ? 'Warm leads notified to {review_email}.' : ''}"

    Add 3 new audit columns if not already present:
    pc_reply_received | pc_reply_intent | pc_reply_snippet
```

---

## PHASE 0 — Read Config

```
0a. Read event_slug from the Paperclip issue description:
    → Scan issue description for a line starting with "event_slug:" or just the slug value on its own
    → If not found: post blocked comment "event_slug missing from issue description. Add it as: event_slug: asca-samba-2026", STOP

    Derive config path: "Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/config.md"

    sharepoint_read_file
    path="Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/config.md"
    → Parse all key: value pairs
    → If file missing: post blocked comment "config.md not found at Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/config.md. Create the folder and config, then retry.", STOP

0b. Validate required config keys present:
    event_name, event_slug, event_dates, event_location, booth_number,
    event_website, attendee_file, batch_size, min_send_pct, send_mode,
    outlook_user, review_email, email_subject, email_body_file

    → If any missing: post blocked comment listing exact missing keys, STOP

0c. Post issue comment:
    "Config loaded. Event: {event_name} | File: {attendee_file} | Batch: {batch_size} | Mode: {send_mode}"
```

---

## PHASE 1 — Load Batch

```
1a. sharepoint_get_file_info
    path="Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/{attendee_file}"
    → If not found: post blocked comment with exact path tried, STOP

1b. Read header row first to map column positions:
    sharepoint_excel_read_range
    → address: "A1:ZZ1"   ← header row only
    → identify column letters for: first_name, last_name, email, company, domain, title,
      prior_delivery_status, pc_status, pc_event, pc_email_used, pc_draft_id, and all audit columns

    Then read ONLY the columns needed for batch selection (never the full sheet):
    sharepoint_excel_read_range
    → address: "{email_col},{company_col},{first_name_col},{last_name_col},{pc_status_col},{pc_event_col},{prior_delivery_status_col}"
    → This reads only the columns needed for idempotency + batch selection
    → Top 10 rows sufficient to validate structure; then read all rows of these columns only

1c. Resolve column map — PARSE ONCE, CACHE FOREVER per event:

    CHECK if column-map.md already exists:
    sharepoint_get_file_info
    path="Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/column-map.md"

    IF exists → check if it contains `prior_delivery_status` mapping.
        If NOT present → delete and re-detect (column map is stale, missing new fields).

    IF exists AND contains all required fields → LOAD cached map:
        sharepoint_read_file
        path="Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/column-map.md"
        → Parse each line: canonical_field: header_name | column_index
        → Build column_map in memory
        → Log: "Column map loaded from cache."

    IF does not exist → PARSE headers now (first run only):
        → Read header row (row index 0) from Excel data already in memory
        → For each canonical field, scan all headers using inference rules from "Canonical field inference rules" table
        → Score each header: exact match = 3pts, starts-with = 2pts, contains = 1pt
        → Assign highest-scoring header to each canonical field
        → If required fields (first_name, last_name, company) have no match:
           post blocked comment:
           "Cannot infer required columns from Excel headers.
            Headers found: {comma-separated list of actual headers}
            Required: first_name, last_name, company.
            Either rename your Excel headers or manually create column-map.md at:
            Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/column-map.md"
           STOP

        → Write column-map.md to SharePoint:
        sharepoint_write_file
        path="Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/column-map.md"
        content:
        ---
        # Column Map — {event_slug}
        # Auto-generated {now ISO}. Edit manually only if Excel headers change.
        # Format: canonical_field: exact_header | column_index   (-1 = not found)

        first_name:  {matched_header}  | {index}
        last_name:   {matched_header}  | {index}
        email:       {matched_header}  | {index or -1}
        company:     {matched_header}  | {index}
        domain:      {matched_header}  | {index or -1}
        title:       {matched_header}  | {index or -1}
        ---

        → Post comment: "First run: column map inferred and cached at Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/column-map.md. Review it if any mapping looks wrong."
        → Log each mapping: "first_name → '{header}' (col {index})"

1d. Find next {batch_size} eligible rows:
    A row is SKIPPED (not eligible) if ANY of:
    → pc_status = "sent" | "draft_created" | "skipped"        (processed this run)
    → pc_event = {event_slug}                                  (already processed for this event)
    → email_delivery_status = "sent"                           (sent by prior system — NEVER re-send)

    A row IS eligible if:
    → pc_status is empty/missing AND pc_event != {event_slug} AND prior_delivery_status != "sent"

    IMPORTANT: When skipping a row due to prior_delivery_status = "sent", write NOTHING to any pc_* column.
    Do not overwrite, do not set pc_status = "sent". Leave it completely untouched.

    → If zero eligible rows:
       post comment "All attendees processed for {event_name}. Nothing to do."
       update issue → done, STOP

1e. Split batch into two groups:
    has_email  = rows where Email column is non-empty
    need_email = rows where Email column is empty

    Post comment:
    "Batch loaded: {batch_size} rows | Has email: {count} | Missing email: {count}"
```

---

## PHASE 2 — Hunter Email Enrichment (missing_email rows only)

Skip this phase entirely if `need_email` list is empty.

```
2a. Check credit budget BEFORE processing any row:
    hunter_account_info
    → store: search_credits_remaining, verify_credits_remaining
    → unprocessed_remaining = total eligible rows not yet sent across all batches
    → safe_fallback_budget  = search_credits_remaining - unprocessed_remaining - 20
      (20 = safety buffer)
    → if safe_fallback_budget > 0: fallback_allowed = true
    → else: fallback_allowed = false
    → Post comment: "Hunter budget check: {search_credits_remaining} search / {verify_credits_remaining} verify credits remaining. Fallback domain search: {fallback_allowed}."

2b. For each row in need_email:

    STEP 1 — Resolve domain (free, no credits):
    → If col_domain exists and cell non-empty → use it directly, skip DuckDuckGo
    → Else: duckduckgo_search query='"{company}" official website'
      → extract domain from first result URL (strip www., keep base domain)
      → If no domain found → mark pc_status="email_not_found", pc_notes="domain not found", continue to next row

    STEP 2 — Primary: hunter_find_email (name + domain):
    hunter_find_email
    → first_name: {first_name}
    → last_name:  {last_name}
    → domain:     {resolved_domain}
    → uses 1 search credit

    On success (email returned):
    → store: hunter_email = email, hunter_confidence = score
    → pc_hunter_method = "email_finder"
    → email_resolved = true
    → SKIP Step 3 — do not use fallback
    → proceed directly to STEP 4 (verify)

    On no result:
    → proceed to STEP 3 (fallback)

    STEP 3 — Fallback: hunter_search_domain (only if Step 2 found nothing):
    IF fallback_allowed = false:
    → mark pc_status="email_not_found", pc_notes="credit budget exhausted, fallback skipped"
    → continue to next row

    IF fallback_allowed = true:
    hunter_search_domain
    → domain: {resolved_domain}
    → limit: 10
    → uses 1 search credit
    → decrement safe_fallback_budget by 1
    → if safe_fallback_budget <= 0: set fallback_allowed = false for remaining rows

    → Scan returned emails, score each by name match:
      score = 0
      if first_name appears in result name → score += 2
      if last_name appears in result name  → score += 3
      select highest scoring result (minimum score 2 to accept)

    On match found (score ≥ 2):
    → store: hunter_email = matched email, hunter_confidence = result confidence
    → pc_hunter_method = "domain_search"
    → email_resolved = true
    → proceed to STEP 4 (verify)

    On no match:
    → mark pc_status="email_not_found", pc_email_source="none"
    → continue to next row

    STEP 4 — Verify email (always, for every Hunter-found email):
    hunter_verify_email
    → email: {hunter_email}
    → uses 1 verify credit

    Result handling:
    → "deliverable"   → pc_email_risk="deliverable", email_resolved=true, proceed to send
    → "risky"         → pc_email_risk="risky",        email_resolved=true, proceed to send + audit
    → "undeliverable" → pc_email_risk="undeliverable", email_resolved=false,
                         pc_status="email_not_found", pc_notes="undeliverable per Hunter verify"
    → error/timeout   → pc_email_risk="unknown", treat as risky (send + audit)

2c. After all rows processed, merge results into has_email group:
    → email_resolved = true  → add to sendable list
    → email_resolved = false → stays out of send list

2d. Post comment:
    "Hunter enrichment complete.
     Found (email_finder): {ef_count} | Found (domain_search): {ds_count}
     Deliverable: {del_count} | Risky: {risky_count} | Undeliverable: {undel_count} | Not found: {nf_count}
     Search credits remaining: ~{search_credits_remaining - credits_used}"
```

---

## PHASE 3 — Sufficiency Check

```
3a. sendable_count = len(has_email)  ← original emails + hunter-found
    total_batch    = batch_size (or actual eligible rows if less)
    send_pct       = (sendable_count / total_batch) * 100

3b. IF send_pct >= min_send_pct:
    → Proceed to Phase 4 — send
    → Post comment: "Sufficiency check passed: {send_pct:.0f}% have email ({sendable_count}/{total_batch}). Proceeding."

3c. IF send_pct < min_send_pct:
    → Post comment:
      "Sufficiency check failed: only {send_pct:.0f}% have email ({sendable_count}/{total_batch}).
       Threshold is {min_send_pct}%. Sending what we have and marking rest as email_not_found."
    → Proceed anyway — send to all rows that DO have an email, skip the rest
    → (Do not block entirely — partial send is better than no send)
```

---

## PHASE 4 — Compose and Send / Draft Emails

```
4a. For each row in sendable (has_email) list:

    Resolve send address:
    → If pc_email_source = "hunter": use hunter_email
    → Else: use original Email column value

    Compose subject:
    → Replace {event_name}, {first_name}, {booth_number}, {event_dates}, {event_location}
      in email_subject from config

    Compose HTML body:
    → sharepoint_read_file path="Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/{email_body_file}"
    → Replace all placeholders in template: {first_name}, {event_name}, {event_dates},
      {event_location}, {booth_number}, {event_website}, {company}, {title}
    → Append standard Medicodio signature block (below)

    Standard signature (always appended — never in config):
    ---
    <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"
      style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:#333;line-height:1.5;border-left:3px solid #0a1d56;padding-left:16px;">
      <tr><td>

          </td></tr>
        </table>
      </td></tr>
    </table>

4b. IF send_mode = "direct":
    resend_send_email  (uses RESEND_API_KEY from env — no daily send limit)
    → from: {outlook_user}
    → to: {resolved_email}
    → subject: {composed_subject}
    → html: {composed_html}
    → on success: mark pc_status = "sent", pc_draft_created_at = blank, pc_sent_at = now ISO
    → on error: mark pc_status = "error", pc_notes = "{error}", continue

4c. IF send_mode = "draft_review":
    outlook_create_draft
    → mailbox: {outlook_user}
    → to: {resolved_email}
    → subject: {composed_subject}
    → body: {composed_html}
    → bodyType: "HTML"
    → save returned draft message ID
    → mark pc_status = "draft_created", pc_draft_id = "{draftId}", pc_draft_created_at = now ISO, pc_sent_at = blank

4d. Post progress comment every 10 rows:
    "Progress: {sent}/{sendable_count} emails {send_mode == direct ? "sent" : "drafted"}."
```

---

## PHASE 5 — Write Audit Columns Back to Excel

```
5a. For every row in this batch (sendable + email_not_found + error):

    sharepoint_excel_write_range
    filePath="Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/{attendee_file}"
    sheetName="{attendee_sheet}"
    → Write per-row values:
       pc_status              = {status}
       pc_email_source        = {original | hunter | none}
       pc_email_used          = {email address used, or blank if not_found}
       pc_draft_created_at    = {ISO timestamp when draft created, or blank}
       pc_sent_at             = {ISO timestamp when actually sent, or blank}
       pc_event               = {event_slug}
       pc_draft_id            = {draft_id or blank}
       pc_hunter_confidence   = {score or blank}
       pc_notes               = {error/skip reason or blank}

5b. Verify write:
    sharepoint_excel_read_range → spot-check 3 random rows
    → Confirm pc_status values persisted
    → Log: "Excel audit write verified."
```

---

## PHASE 6 — Notify Reviewer (draft_review mode only)

Skip if `send_mode = "direct"`.

```
6a. Compose summary table:
    | First Name | Last Name | Company | Draft ID |
    ...one row per draft created

6b. resend_send_email  (uses RESEND_API_KEY — no daily limit)
    → from: {outlook_user}
    → to: {review_email}
    → subject: "[{event_name}] {N} outreach drafts ready for review — {today date}"
    → body:
      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p>{N} outreach emails drafted for <strong>{event_name}</strong> attendees and saved to Outlook Drafts.</p>
      {summary_table}
      <p>To send: go to Paperclip issue #{issueId} and click Approve.<br>
         To skip: reject with a note.</p>
      <p>— Marketing Specialist</p>

6c. Create Paperclip approval on current issue:
    → title: "Review and approve {N} outreach drafts for {event_name}"
    → body: summary table + draft IDs
    → required approver: {review_email} user

6d. Post comment:
    "{N} drafts created. Approval requested. Awaiting review before sending."
```

---

## PHASE 7 — On Approval (draft_review mode only)

```
7a. Agent receives approval notification

7b. Read draft IDs from approval body

7c. For each row in this batch (read pc_email_used + composed body from memory or re-read draft):
    resend_send_email  (uses RESEND_API_KEY — no daily limit)
    → from: {outlook_user}
    → to: {pc_email_used}
    → subject: {composed_subject}
    → html: {composed_html}
    → on success: note sent
    → on error: note failure, continue others

    Note: Outlook drafts created in Phase 4 are for preview only.
    Resend is the actual delivery mechanism on approval.
    Delete or ignore the Outlook draft after send.

7d. sharepoint_excel_write_range
    → For each sent row: pc_status = "sent", pc_sent_at = now ISO  (pc_draft_created_at unchanged)
    → For any failed: pc_status = "send_failed", pc_notes = "{error}"

7e. Post final comment:
    "All {N} emails sent for {event_name}. Excel updated."

7f. Update issue → done
```

## On Rejection (draft_review mode only)

```
7g. Read rejection reason
7h. sharepoint_excel_write_range → pc_status = "skipped", pc_notes = "{rejection reason}"
7i. Post comment: "Approval rejected. Rows marked skipped. Reason: {reason}"
7j. Update issue → done
```

---

## PHASE 8 — Run Log and Summary

```
8a. sharepoint_write_file
    path="Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/{event_slug}/run-logs/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md"
    content:
    ---

## How to Run for a New Event

1. Upload `{event}.xlsx` to SharePoint at `Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/`
2. Edit `Marketing-Specialist/event-outreach/config.md` (update event fields + filename)
3. Create a Paperclip issue assigned to `marketing-specialist`
4. Done — routine reads fresh config, processes attendees, no code change

---

## Reuse Guarantee

- The `.md` routine file: **never edit between events**
- The attendee Excel: **upload new file per event**
- The config: **update 6–8 fields per event**
- Hunter API key: **set once in env, reused forever**
